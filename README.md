# Periodic Table in Python

## Overview
The **Periodic Table in Python** project is designed to help students and enthusiasts explore the properties of chemical elements interactively. This Python-based program allows users to retrieve detailed information about elements, including their atomic number, symbol, atomic mass, phase, and other essential characteristics. Additionally, it displays an image of the element and provides a Wikipedia link for further reading.

This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/tusharrbhardwaj/Periodic-Table-in-python), where you can access the full source code and contribute to its development.

## Features
- Search elements by **atomic number** or **name**
- Displays detailed **physical and chemical properties** of elements
- Shows an **image** of the element using Tkinter
- Provides a **Wikipedia link** for in-depth research
- Utilizes **CSV files** to store element data
